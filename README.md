# Adobe-Gensolve-Hackathon-Solution
In this Project we are implementing 3 given task which majorly revolves around the Shape detection, symmetry detection and completing the curves using different python libraries and Algorithms.


TASK-1 SHAPE DETECTION -USING COMPUTER VSION LIBRARY,CLEANING OF IMAGE BY DIFFERENT WAYS LIKE GAUSSIAN BLUR,ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD ETC

TASK-2 SYMMETRY DETECTION-USING LIBRARY CALLED STRUCTURAL_SIMILARITY INDEX THAT CHECKS AND ROATATE THE IMAGE TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE MIRROR IMAGE OF EACH OTHER OR NOT.


TASK-3 BEST SOLUTION GIVEN SEPRATELY AS ALTERNATE_SOLUTION TASK 3- USES Canny Edge Detection, Gradient Orientation Calculation,R-Table Construction ,Generalized Hough Transform,Multi-Scale and Shift Detection,Image Rotation AND Image Overlay
